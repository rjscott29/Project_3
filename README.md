# Project_3

Again, this is the same card game as used in Project 1 and Project 2.

Simulate an experiment with CardgameSim.py where you manipulate the number of games, number of cards, number of sets, and number of cheater cards.

Running CardgameAnalysis.py will give a plot that shows the predicted G value based on which G maximized the likelihood of the data.

A sample game is given in game.txt
